# Timeseries_Forcasting

Training and comparing 3 different time-series forecasting algorithms (Python language), algorithms were selected as follows: 1. Feed-Forward  Neural Network 2. Long Short-Term Memory with 1 parameter and 4. Long Short-Term Memory with 5 parameters. by using 4 sources of weather data to find the best forecasting model (lowest RMSE).
Data from 4 sources were selected by comparing results from 5 different methods.

This project contains 7 .py as follows:
1. 5 feature selection compare.py - comparing results from 5 different feature selection methods.
2. LR_MMT_test_FF.py - Tuning Learning rate and Momentum for feed-forward neural network.
3. LR_MMT_test_LSTM1.py - Tuning Learning rate and Momentum for  Long Short-Term Memory with 1 parameter.
4. LR_MMT_test_LSTM5.py - Tuning Learning rate and Momentum for  Long Short-Term Memory with 1 parameters.
5. Feed forward Neural network timeserise.py - time-series forecasting by feed-forward neural network.
6. LSTM timeseries.py - time-series forecasting by Long Short-Term Memory with 1 parameter.
7. LSTM Multi timeseries.py - time-series forecasting by Long Short-Term Memory with 5 parameters.
