# Timeseries_Forcasting

Training and comparing 3 different time-series forecasting algorithms (Python language), algorithms were selected as follows: 1. Feed-Forward  Neural Network 2. Long Short-Term Memory with 1 parameter and 4. Long Short-Term Memory with 5 parameters. by using 4 sources of weather data to find the best forecasting model (lowest RMSE).
Data from 4 sources were selected by comparing result from 5 difference methods.
